Hi Chase!

My name is Haotian Mai, I am a senior studying data journalism. I am orginally from China. 

I won't expect you to know how to pronounce my name. I already heard a donzen different versions already haha!

I am very excited to learn different tools to improve my story-telling ability. I had a bit experience with SQL, HTML, CSS and Java Script from my previous classes, which I never imagine I would be learning since I kinda suck at math (I always feel there is a strong connection between math and coding) But coding is actually a lot of fun, later I found. So I am very excited to learn about Python this semester, and cross-finger for the upcoming challenges!

Ps. I am going to NICAR in March, hope to meet you there!

Cheers
